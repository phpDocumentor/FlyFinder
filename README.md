FlyFinder
=========

FlyFinder is a plugin for [Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/) that will enable you to find files
based on certain criteria.

FlyFinder can search for files that are hidden (either because they are hidden files themselves, or because they are
inside a hidden directory), that have a certain extension, or that exist in a certain path.

Flyfinder does *not* return directories themselves... only files.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this library is with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) using the following command:

    $ composer require phpdocumentor/flyfinder

## Examples

Ready to dive in and don't want to read through all that text below? Just consult the [examples](examples) folder and
check which type of action that your want to accomplish.

## Usage

In order to use the FlyFinder plugin you first need a Flyfinder filesystem with an adapter,
for instance the local adapter.

    use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
    use League\Flysystem\Adapter;
    use Flyfinder\Finder;

    $filesystem = new Filesystem(new Adapter\Local(__DIR__.'/path/to/files/'));

Now you can add the plugin as follows:

    $filesystem->addPlugin(new Finder());

FlyFinder will need specifications to know what to look for. The following specifications are available:

- IsHidden (this specification will return `true` when a file or directory is hidden,
- HasExtension (this specification will return `true` when a file or directory has the specified extension),
- InPath (this specification will return `true` when a file is in the given path. Wildcards are allowed.)
  - note that this path should be considered relative to the `$filesystem`'s path

Specifications can be instantiated as follows:

    use Flyfinder\Path;
    use Flyfinder\Specification\IsHidden;
    use Flyfinder\Specification\HasExtension;
    use Flyfinder\Specification\InPath;

    $isHidden = new IsHidden();
    $hasExtension = new HasExtension(['txt']);
    $inPath = new InPath(new Path('mydir'));

### Combining specifications

You can search on more criteria by combining the specifications. Specifications can be chained as follows:

`$isHidden->andSpecification($hasExtension)` will find all files and directories that are hidden AND have the given
extension.

`$isHidden->orSpecification($hasExtension)` will find all files and directories that are hidden OR have the given
extension.

`$isHidden->notSpecification` will find all files and directories that are NOT hidden.

You can also make longer chains like this:

` $specification = $inPath->andSpecification($hasExtension)->andSpecification($isHidden->notSpecification());`

This will find all files in the given path, that have the given extension and are not hidden.
